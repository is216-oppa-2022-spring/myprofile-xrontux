# :wave: My Profile

## ðŸ¤“ Objective
The goal of "My Profile" assignment is to give every student an opportunity to build a beautiful, interactive, and responsive website on a weekly basis. This is a term-long assignment (Week 1 through Week 16), and it will count towards your **Class Participation**.

Each week, you need to **update README** and describe the new changes you've implemented. Create a **new section** for **each new week**. For example, see below:

## (Week 1) My First GitHub Commit & Push
* Created my first personal webpage using whatever HTML I can remember from IS113 (Web Application Development I).
* Commited and pushed a file to my repository!

## (Week 2) CSS to Beautify My Web Pages
* Added a new webpage for my resume.
* Applied CSS I learned in class to my web pages.

## (Week 3) something goes here
